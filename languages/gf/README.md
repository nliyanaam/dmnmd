# Natural Language Generation of DMN/FEEL Expressions using GF

To run this, you will need to install [GF](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/). You'll also need the [resource grammar library](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-rgl) and the [gf-wordnet](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-wordnet).

### TODO

* Connect this to a format with more metadata
* Connect the WordNet lexicon into other resources. Try e.g. [this](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/WordNet-1.1.0/docs/NLP-WordNet.html)
